# .WIZZI/TESTS/ITTF__COPY

The content of this directory, having a `__copy` suffix, is copied as is
to the destination folder. The folder is renamed eliminating the suffix (becomes `ittf`).

ITTF documents that must be loaded when in the destination package must be copied
suppressing their processing by the Wizzi job.

More information about the usage of the `__copy` directories in the documentation:
